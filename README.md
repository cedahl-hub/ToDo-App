Overview
Build a functional To-Do List Application using Python from scratch.

Project
In VS Code, create a .py file and complete the following requirements:

User Interface (UI) and Storage Method
- Build a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) that welcomes users and displays a menu with options to add, view, delete tasks, or quit the application.
- The tasks should be stored in a Python list
Core Features
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Delete tasks
- Quit the application
User Interaction
- Use input() to capture user selections and ensure proper input validation to handle invalid choices.
Error Handling
- Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch errors
- Alert the user if they provide invalid input
- Alert the user if there are no tasks to view
- Alert the user if they try to delete a task that doesn't exist
- Alert the user if they select an option on the main menu that doesn't exist
Code Organization
- Organize your code into functions to improve clarity and maintainability. 
- Use descriptive function names and add comments/docstrings where necessary.
